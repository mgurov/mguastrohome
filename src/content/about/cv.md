##### Work

jan 2021-now [iptiQ](https://www.iptiq.com/) Hoofddorp NL - insuretech

As a Product Engineer, my primary role across multiple teams has been to streamline technical support operations and align the quality of deliverables with the company transition from startup to scale-up mode. And the teams were:

CIL team - **Customer support platform** with capabilities for policy and claim administration, call routing, SMS, email, task management. Introduced a full-stack approach to the team, which was previously silo'ed between Front- and Back-end. Regained control over a sizeable legacy React.js application by redesigning the test strategy towards [comprehensive and thoughtful automatic test coverage](/talks/app-testing-with-playwright/).

Joined **Integrations** team to build integration with Dutch road authorities ([RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) and [Roydata](https://www.seps.nl/roy-data/)). Main contribution in breaking the team paralysis in the face of seemingly insurmountable ambiguity in requirements, and readjusting the delivery process into an iterative one with early business involvement.

**Payments** team - coached the team to build resilient payment processing in a distributed environment. Led refactoring for more transparent processing of payments. Introduced team-owned UIs that drastically improved technical operational support efficiency. Sped up delivery process from once in month to continuous deployment.

2015-2020 [bol.com](https://bol.com) Utrecht NL - e-commerce

Mainly with feature teams in Logistics and Purchasing domains, but also with platform teams. Liaison and advocate between feature and platform / DX teams.  Transition from Oracle-backed monoliths to Java and Kotlin microservice. From on-premise to cloud (GCP). 

Teams & domains: 

Falcon. The **data-inflight** team building bridge between operational and data-lake databases. Joined to develop and spread in usage a custom built data quality tool. Built a tailored automated testing process that allowed to practice near continuous delivery to numerous installations across the organization. 

Purchasing & Supplier accounting. Recovered the domain from technical downfall. Brought testing and observability practices to the level that allowed to move to [trunk-based continuous delivery development](/talks/trunk-based-delivery/). Designed and build cross-dock microservice in close iterative collaboration with business stakeholder, featuring custom-built UIs for requirements analysis and observability, as well as [extensive testing on production via gradual process takeover](/talks/testing-on-production/). Later was involved as a domain expert / analyst in the redesign of a supplier accounting subsystem.

Logistics. Landed at "logistics via bol" - partner delivery program similar to "Fulfillment by Amazon", a "tech excellence" team spearheading migration to microservices and from oracle to postgres. Revolutionized dev testing by broad use of docker containers, which was a relative novelty at the time.
