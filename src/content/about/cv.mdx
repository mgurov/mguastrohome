##### Work

jan 2021-now [iptiQ](https://www.iptiq.com/) Hoofddorp NL - insuretech

Product Engineer. Primarily focued on streamlining technical support operations and aligning the quality of deliverables with  an organisational transition from startup to scale-up.

CIL team - **Customer support platform** with capabilities for policy administration, call routing, SMS, email, task management. Introduced a **full-stack approach** to the previously silo'ed (Front- v Back-end) team. Regained control over a sizeable legacy React.js application by redesigning the test strategy towards [comprehensive and meaningful test coverage](/talks/app-testing-with-playwright/). Shifted the team focus towards the user satisfaction and early problem detection with **UI observability**. Introduced python jupyter notebooks as an OPS tool. 

Joined **Integrations** team to build an interface with Dutch road authorities ([RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) and [Roydata](https://www.seps.nl/roy-data/)). Broke the team paralysis in the face of seemingly insurmountable ambiguity in requirements. Readjusted the delivery process into an iterative one with early business stakeholders involvement.

**Payments** team - coached to improve the reliability of the transaction processing in a distributed environment. Led refactoring for more transparent processing of payments. Introduced team-owned UIs that drastically improved technical operational support efficiency. Sped up delivery process from once in months to continuous deployment.

2015-2020 [bol.com](https://bol.com) Utrecht NL - e-commerce

Informal **liaison and advocate** between feature and platform / DX teams. Transition from Oracle-backed monoliths to Java and Kotlin microservices. From on-premise to cloud (GCP). Created popular dev tools (internal with Go and React).

Teams & domains: 

A **data-in-flight** platform team building bridge between operational and data-lake databases. Joined to develop and spread in usage a custom built **continuous data quality monitoring** tool. Built a tailored automated testing process that allowed to practice near continuous delivery to numerous installations across the organization. 

Purchasing & Supplier accounting. Recovered the domain from technical downfall. Brought **testing and observability** practices to the level that allowed to move to **[trunk-based continuous delivery development](/talks/trunk-based-delivery/)**. Designed and built cross-dock service in close iterative collaboration with business stakeholders, featuring custom-built UIs for requirements analysis and observability, as well as [extensive testing on production via gradual process takeover](/talks/testing-on-production/). 

Landed at "logistics via bol" - a "startup within a large organization" partner delivery program similar to the "Fulfillment by Amazon". A "tech excellence" team spearheading migration to microservices and from oracle to postgres. Revolutionized dev testing by shortening feedback loops with docker.
