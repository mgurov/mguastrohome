As a (Senior) Product Engineer, my primary role across multiple teams has been to streamlining technical support operations and align the quality of deliverables with the company transition from startup to scale-up mode. And the teams were:

CIL team - **Customer support platform** with policy and claim administration, phone call routing, SMS, email, task management etc. capabilities. Introduced the full-stack approach to the team, which was previously silo'ed between Front- and Back-end. Regained control over a sizeable legacy React.js application by redesigning the test strategy towrads [extensive and thoughtful automatic test coverage](../talks/app-testing-with-playwright/).

**Authorities Integrations** team - e.g. reporting an auto insured to goverment or industry agencies. Joined to build integration with Dutch authorities ([RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/), [Roydata](https://www.seps.nl/roy-data/)). Main contribution in breaking the team paralysis in the face of seemingly insurmountable ambiguity in requirements, and readjusting the delivery process into an iterative one with early business involvement.

**Payments** team - coached the team to build resilient payment processing in a distributed environent. Architected refactoring for more transparent processing of payments. Introduced team-owned UIs that drastically improved technical operational support efficiency.
